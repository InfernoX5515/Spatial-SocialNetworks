# Spatial Social Networks

In this project, we tackle a useful problem, keyword-based community search over spatial-social networks (KCS-SSN), which retrieves a community of users who are constrained by query keywords (w.r.t. user interests/preferences and POI keywords) and have high social and spatial cohesiveness (e.g., constraints of (k, d)-truss and average road-network distances). We propose efficient and effective algorithms to enable fast retrieval of community answers and design a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with users.

## Contributions

- Formalized the problem of community search over spatial-social networks
- Provide a user-friendly interface to plot, visualize, and analyze spatial-social network
- Design efficient techniques for keyword-based community searching

## Getting Started
